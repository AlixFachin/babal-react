# Some fun with exploring 3JS ðŸ˜Ž

This project is a revisit of a game I used to play during physics class in high school on my HP48 calculator.
(The original is at <https://www.hpcalc.org/details/880>).

The idea is that you control a ball which bounces off a flat surface, and try not to fall into the holes in the terrain.

# How to play

## On Desktop:

You control the ball with the arrows and jump with the space bar. Try not to fall in the holes.

## On Mobile (TBD)

# Tech used ðŸ’»

- [Three js](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Vector3)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to detect typos (useful when you code on your side projects after a long day of work!)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for testing
- [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) for state machines / state management
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing
